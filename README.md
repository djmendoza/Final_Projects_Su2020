#### Type III Project Background:
Since 2015, The Washington Post ("The Post") has been building a database of fatal police shootings in the United States,
along with pertinent information relating to each incident (e.g., race of participants , gender, body-cams,
if the deceased was suffering a mental-health crisis, etc.).
According to The Post, their dataset is nearly twice the size as the official FBI dataset on the same subject, due in part to varied reporting
practices among policing agencies, as well as other factors, and notes, "5480 people have been shot and killed by police since Jan. 1, 2015" (Tate et al., 2015).

The Post recently released this dataset has recently become available for public use, and the kernel I will be reviewing and enhancing is the top-rated kernel based
on the data; Mrinaal007's kernel uses Numpy and Pandas, as well as visualization/plotting modules (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn).

#### Project Hypotheses:
My initial hypotheses is that there are a number of areas for analysis as that could be cleaned up as they hurt credibility.
Likewise, initial overview of the kernel seems to indicate competent use of pandas, but these are initial trouble spots for analysis or enhancement.
It looks at age, race, body-cam use, as well as other scenarios. There is a congruence with the scenario presented by The Post
(i.e., "Black Americans are killed at a much higher rate than white Americans")(Tate et al., 2020), but I suspect the other areas need review.

#### This README will continue to be edited to reflect the project as it develops.
