## Type III Project Background

Since 2015, The Washington Post ("The Post") has been building a database of fatal police shootings in the United States,
along with pertinent information relating to each incident (e.g., race of participants , gender, body-cams,
if the deceased was suffering a mental-health crisis, etc.).
According to The Post, their dataset is nearly twice the size as the official FBI dataset on the same subject, due in part to varied reporting
practices among policing agencies, as well as other factors, and notes, "5480 people have been shot and killed by police since Jan. 1, 2015" (Tate et al., 2015).

The Post recently released this dataset has recently become available for public use, and the kernel I will be reviewing and enhancing ~is~ was the top-rated kernel based
on the data. A legacy copy, as well as my annotated review copy, is included in this GitHub Repo.  
Mrinaal007's kernel uses Numpy and Pandas, as well as visualization/plotting modules (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn).

## Initial Project Hypotheses

My initial hypotheses is that there are a number of areas for analysis as that could be cleaned up as they hurt credibility.
Likewise, initial overview of the kernel seems to indicate competent use of pandas, but these are initial trouble spots for analysis or enhancement.
It looks at age, race, body-cam use, as well as other scenarios. There is a congruence with the scenario presented by The Post
(i.e., "Black Americans are killed at a much higher rate than white Americans") (Tate et al., 2020), but I suspect the other areas need review.

The Type III review will cover 3 areas relating to the project:

1. Project Code Review: A detailed review of user Mrinaal007's kernal notebook based on John Weible's *Program Quality and Code Reviews* (Weible, 2020) featuring some analysis.
2. Kaggel Project Analysis Review: An detailed analysis of one of the sections of the project, featuring an enhancement.
3. Fatal Force Database Analysis: A brief analysis of racial categories in the Washington Post's *Fatal Force* database.

## Project I have be reviewed and enhanced

Mrinaal007 (alias). (2020, July 11). ðŸ‘®ðŸ”« Police Shootouts ðŸ‘®ðŸ”«. Retrieved July 27, 2020, from https://www.kaggle.com/mrinaal007/police-shootouts (now defunct)

- It appears that the user Mrninaal007 has either deleted this project or made it private; the above link returns a 404 error. As such, I have included 2 copies in this repository.
  - One is essentially an untouched version of the original Kaggle kernal with only minor changes to accommodate loading the csv from a local file.
  - The second, [located here](https://github.com/djmendoza/Final_Projects_Su2020/blob/master/Final_project/%F0%9F%91%AE%F0%9F%94%AB%20Police%20Shootouts%20%20%F0%9F%91%AE%F0%9F%94%AB.ipynb), features my review and analysis in full.

## Installation and Setup

* Download a clone of the Git repository and run "ðŸ‘®ðŸ”« Police Shootouts ðŸ‘®ðŸ”«" from the local file location in Jupter Notebooks (Recommended).

* Alteratively, a limited version can be previewed here at:
  * (Not Reccomended)     [nbviewer> djmendoza >Final_Projects_Su2020>Final_project>ðŸ‘®ðŸ”« Police Shootouts ðŸ‘®ðŸ”«.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
  * (Not Reccomended)  [Direct link (may not be up-to-date)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/djmendoza/Final_Projects_Su2020/blob/master/Final_project/%F0%9F%91%AE%F0%9F%94%AB%20Police%20Shootouts%20%20%F0%9F%91%AE%F0%9F%94%AB.ipynb)
 (See Issue 2, Below)

## Known Issues and Troubleshooting

Issue 1: The original project's plotted cells do not always post as expected when initially opening Jupyter Notebook.
- Solution: In the Jupyter Notebook dropdown menu: Select `Kernal > Restart & Run All`, or `Run` each cell individually.

Issue 2: Error when rendering at `In [56]:`
    `hm = hm.unstack()`
    `hm.style.background_gradient(cmap='Blues')`
- Solution: removed from final version; may still appear in nbviewer version.
